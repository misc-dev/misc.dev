Microphone check, one two, one two!

In this blog I will discuss things I am interested in, which are broad and varied, hence the name ***misc***. I will try to stay (mostly) focused on topics related to my professional career, thus topics that will likely be covered most often include:
- **M**: Management
- **I**: Information Studies (and Interface/Interaction Design)
- **S**: Systems Thinking/Theory
- **C**: Complexity
- and of course, software **dev**elopment

Hence, again, the name **misc.dev**.
